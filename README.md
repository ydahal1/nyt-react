The New York Times Article Saver application featured on this page is built in two different versions: a Mongo Database Scraper and a React Application.  Both sites accomplish the goal of finding articles from the New York Times and give users the ability to save articles to a mongo database.  Zachary Saltzman was responsible for all aspects of these applications.

Technologies Used: MongoDB, Express, React, Node as well as Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Description:

The (React JS) New York Times Article Scrubber utilizes the New York Times API to allow users to search through archived articles matching their search criteria (topic, start year, and end year).  From there, users are able to either view the article or save the article to their "saved articles" in the mongo database.  On the "saved articles" page, users have the option to delete saved articles.  The entire application is done with component rendering via React.
